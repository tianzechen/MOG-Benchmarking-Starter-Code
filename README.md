This repository provides **starter code** for benchmarking **multi-object grasping (MOG)** tasks in simulation.  
It demonstrates grasping and transferring objects from a source bin to conveyor belt bins using a **stochastic finger movement strategy** given any pre-grasp pose.  

Researchers and developers are encouraged to extend this starter code with their own control algorithms, grasping strategies, and benchmarking methods.  ![example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a98c773f-c451-45bb-85c8-9a8df347db80)

## âœ¨ Features
- Integration with **CoppeliaSim 4.4.0** for physics-based robot simulation.  
- Starter implementation of a **stochastic movement strategy** for robot fingers.  
- Example simulation scene (`40mm_sphere.ttt`) included.  
- Modular Python API for extending and customizing experiments.  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads) **version 4.4.0**  
- Python â‰¥ 3.7

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tianzechen/MOG-Benchmarking-Starter-Code.git
   cd MOG-Benchmarking-Starter-Code
2. Launch CoppeliaSim with the provided scene
3. Run the Starter code:
   ```bash
   python starter_code.py
4. Observe the robot grasping and transferring objects to the conveyor bins

## ðŸ“Š Benchmarking
This repo is intended as a foundation for **MOG benchmarking**. Future extensions may include:  
- Performance metrics (success rate, grasp efficiency, transfer throughput).  
- Comparisons between different grasp strategies.  
- Visualization and logging utilities.
